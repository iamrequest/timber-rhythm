# Timber Rhythm

A retro-inspired music sandbox, for PCVR (SteamVR). Jam out, and let the Loop Machine play it back to you~

This was my submission to "[VRJam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/vr-jam-2021)", a 2.5 day game jam.

You can download the game for free here, on [itch.io](https://request.itch.io/timber-rhythm), or you can check out my other projects at [request.moe](https://request.moe).

You're free to do whatever with this code, but if you do use it, it'd be real cool of you to link back to this page or the itch.io page (or both). Thanks!
